# Dot Files

My dotfiles, including:

- [neovim](.config/nvim/README.md) (needs neovim >= v0.10.1)
- kitty
- polybar
- zsh
- prezto conf for my [prezto fork](https://github.com/dcarrillo/prezto)
- p10k

In addition to the dotfiles, some Gnome shell extension confs are included to make polybar and cli great again on Gnome.
